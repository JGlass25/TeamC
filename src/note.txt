If you take a look in "Barb.php" you'll see I have 30 edges between
the classrooms and stair cases, many of them are duplicates and are 
marked with a * (for stairs I think we should use an arrow for going 
up or down so those are not duplicates, I count 21 total edges. 
Could we potentially create map images for each unique 
edge and then overlay them dynamically to create each path rather
than creating the whole path in one? Otherwise the actual path finding 
will only be useful for determining the total distance and not the actual
path. If that seems too hard I'll help you set up the program so you can 
run it and find the path best while you're making the images.
